# Google Foobar Challenge 2022

Have you ever taken a trip that you have been planning for a long time, building it up in your head, only to be disappointed when in the end you get there. This was not one of those journeys.

>We are a species of storytellers, and fooBar makes you the protagonist in a story to infiltrate and dismantle ***Commander Lambda***’s evil organisation, where all you have are your wits about you to save your bunny comrades. And along this journey, you will learn as you go. From Markov Chains, to Cellular automata, there are so many fascinating ideas and concepts that the challenge exposed me to.

>Then one fine day, as I was fiddling away at some block of code, I probably got some error, or needed to look up some syntax, and as I Googled, the browser contorted to show me this message:

If you get the invite, and you like to code and like a challenge I’ll strongly recommend you take FooBar up on the offer.

One other point to note, if you are comfortable with python, it might make a lot of sense to go with it, as the standard library will provide you lots of useful functions. I personally used Java, as I am more comfortable with it, and frankly I am not a big fan of Python

>FooBar is Google's secret recruiting process embedded within their search engine <br>
